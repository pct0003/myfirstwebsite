## Welcome to my site

This is [a hyperlink to google](http://google.com).

Can I use html?

<b>This should be bold</b>

<font color="red">This should be red</font>
_Red doesn't work._

There should be a 560x315 google doc here:

### Exploring markdown
```markdown
# Header 1

- list item1
- item 2

`code` looks like this

```


_But what if I do this outside of markdown?_
- item1
- item2

**I can write in bold**

Trying blockquote

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pct0003/myfirstwebsite/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
